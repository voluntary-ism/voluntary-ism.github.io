# Summary

Voluntaryism is the idea that all human interaction should be voluntary and that this will lead to a better world.

## Vision

A better world for the average person includes:

* Less suffering.
* Less disease.
* Less crime.
* Less death.
* More wealth.
* More technology.
* More science.
* More opportunities.

## Not Utopian

In the same way that moving from a Monarchy to a Democracy/Republic achieved a better world in the above ways, the same will happen if we move from a Democracy/Republic to Voluntaryism. There will still be problems in society which we'll have to work together to deal with as best we can.
