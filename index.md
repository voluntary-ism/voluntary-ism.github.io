# Summary

Voluntaryism is the idea that all human interaction should be voluntary and that this will lead to a better and more just world.

## Vision

A better world for the average person includes:

* Less suffering.
* Less disease.
* Less crime.
* Less death.
* More wealth.
* More technology.
* More security.
* More justice.

## Not Utopian

In the same way that moving from Monarchies a few hundred years ago to modern societies achieved a better world in the above ways, even more progress will happen if we move to Voluntaryism. There will still be problems in society which we'll have to deal with as best we can.

## Not Teenage Naivet√©

There are many detailed investigations by professors into voluntaryism. In particular, [The Problem of Political Authority](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Political-Authority-Examination-Coerce/dp/1137281650/) by [Dr. Michael Huemer](http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/people/michael-huemer) and [The Machinery of Freedom](https://www.amazon.com/Machinery-Freedom-Guide-Radical-Capitalism/dp/1507785607/) by [Dr. David Friedman](http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/friedman-david/), amongst many others.

## Basic Outline

Voluntaryism is very similar to a modern society:

1. People may own property or rent space on someone else's property.
1. People specialize in different jobs: some will make food, others will build things, some will be artists, etc.
1. People exchange goods and services using money or barter.

Voluntaryism simply takes these to the logical conclusion: why can't police, courts, roads, geographical defense, and other government functions be just like supermarkets? We know from history that governments are bad at planning food distribution, and it's reasonable to assume they're just as bad at everything else.

## Anarchy

People have been taught to think that the lack of rulers - anarchy - is synonymous with chaos. There is some truth to this because many anarchists have been either violent socialist anarchists or simply people that hated society. Voluntaryism is non-socialist and wants the best for society. Voluntaryists don't believe in violent revolution but rather believe that the idea will take hold and we'll peacefully shed our barbaric government roots just like we shed our barbaric roots of slavery and misogyny.

## What is government?

Government is a set of people that believe they have ultimate authority over a particular geography. This perceived authority is used to take wealth from people in return for services such as law, police, national defense, roads, etc. People may not compete with core government services. Thus, government establishes monopolies on certain societal functions.

If a person doesn't pay their taxes, they are warned. If the person still doesn't pay, police will forcefully take them to a prison. If a person resists the police, the person may be murdered by the police.

## Evidence of Government versus Freedom

Humanity has run a few near-experiments that suggest that the overall prosperity of society declines as government power increases. Germany and Korea are the best evidence we have because both halves started from similar points with similar cultures and histories, and then after a few decades, dramatically diverged:

### West Germany versus East Germany

After World War II ended in 1945, Germany was [split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Agreement) into a more free western half and a more government controlled eastern half. Analysis by Marc Luy at the Institute for Sociology and Demography at the University of Rostock in 2006 found that life expectancy - a good proxy for the quality of society - increased at a slower rate in West Germany after a few decades. After [reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification) in 1990, West Germany nearly rebounded quite quickly.

### South Korea versus North Korea

After the Korean War ended in 1953, Korea was [split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) into a more free southern half and a more government controlled northern half. The differences after 65 years are stark. Today, South Korea is nearly in the [top 10 of world economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea#Economy), whereas North Korea is one of the [poorest countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea#Economy). Details of modern North Korea may be found in [Dear Reader](https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Reader-Unauthorized-Autobiography-Jong/dp/1495283259/) by Michael Malice.

### Government versus Freedom, Generally

Dr. Rudolph Rummel of the University of Hawaii has estimated that governments killed [262 million](https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM) of its own citizens in the 20th century.
